# Analyzing Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Election 2016

### Summary
* This notebook is a data analysis of Rio's 2016 Municipal Election. 
- The winner was Marcelo Crivella (Republicano Party - Right Wing ), with more than 1.7 million votes.
- The 2nd place was Marcelo Freixo (PSOL Party - Left Wing), with about 1 million votes. 

### Dataset

For this analysis several datasets were used, such as: 
- Shapefile of Rio's Electoral Zones
- Shapefile of Rio's neighborhoods
- Rio de Janeiro HDI
- Electoral Results

### Objective

The main objective was to see in each electoral zones the candidate that have won, the percentage of abstention, null and blank votes. Furthermore compare the HDI of neighborhoods to the candidate-winning-zone, to check wether the left wing party speach was reaching out the poor areas or not.

### Results

- The number of abstentions was the highest in the history of elections until then.
- The PSOL's speech to the masses was not good enough, since it remained only in the most elite neighborhoods.
- Crivella already had a certain reputation for being a pastor, taking a large part of the votes of the religious.
- If the abstention in the Central and South Zones were lower, perhaps the final result would be tighter, and who knows another: Freixo Mayor
- Parallel power can have an influence on the vote, since Freixo was the rapporteur of the presence of Militias in several areas of the city.
